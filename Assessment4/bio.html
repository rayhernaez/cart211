                <h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
                <p>
                    After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family marked by the
                    experiences of war and
                    exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer, profoundly
                    shaped his
                    imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to learn how to read
                    and write.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English from Brooklyn
                    College, followed by
                    an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.
                </p>

                <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
                <p>
                    His first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the collection Night Sky with
                    Exit Wounds (2016)
                    that he gained international recognition. His poetry explores themes of the Vietnam War's legacy,
                    migration, queer
                    identity, and the fragility of language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2019, he published his debut novel, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, widely acclaimed by critics.
                    Written as a letter
                    to his illiterate mother, the book intertwines autobiography, family history, and reflections on
                    sexuality, race, and
                    inherited trauma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2022, he released Time Is a Mother, a poetry collection shaped by mourning his mother's death and
                    an even more
                    intimate exploration of grief and survival.
                    Ocean Vuong currently teaches literature and creative writing at the University of Massachusetts
                    Amherst.
