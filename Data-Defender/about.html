                About the site
            </h2>
            <p>
                Data Defender is a mini training game. You'll see 8 scenarios from everyday internet life and pick what
                you would do. If you get most answers right, you earn a simple certificate at the end. This site is
                kid-friendly and does not track you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Data Defender runs in your browser only. Each scene randomizes the choices, you tap one, and the “Next”
                button appears. Your progress (alias, your choices, score, and the date you finished) is saved to your
                own device using <em>localStorage</em> so the quiz can move from page to page. Your alias is just for
                the certificate screen and never leaves your device. When you start the quiz again, the saved data is
                cleared. This project does not use ads, trackers, or analytics. It loads images and sounds from the site
                files, and fonts from Google Fonts.

            <p>
                Some apps and sites make money by learning what people do online and guessing what they'll do next. This
                website project is not meant to scare you. It shows small and practical choices you can make. The goal
                is pretty simple: share less, turn on only the permissions necessary, and keep your voice your own.
